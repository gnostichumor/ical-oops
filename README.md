# ical-oops

A simple CLI to update iCal files with STATUS:CANCELLED for each event.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ical-oops
```

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ical-undo`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd ical-undo`
3. Install the package: `pip install .`
4. Use the CLI: `ical-oops input.ics output.ics`

This tool is a simple CLI that takes an iCal file as input and outputs a new iCal file with the same events but with the STATUS:CANCELLED property added to each event.

Adding STATUS:CANCELLED to each event in the ical file will allow you to import it into your calendar and it will mark each event as cancelled.

This is useful if you have a large number of events in your calendar and you want to mark them as cancelled. For example, if you accidentally import a calendar file with a large number of events, you can use this tool to mark them as cancelled.
